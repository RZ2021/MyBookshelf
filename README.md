# MyBookshelf
A book inventory program

This program creates an inventory for the user to store information about their book collection. It uses WPF and an SQL server to run. 
For now, only the inventory is completed but there will be other sections added like a wishlist, reviews, reading tracker, inventories 
for other types of media (Movies, tv shows, video games, cds, etc), and settings to personalize the program. 

This program is a current work in progress.
